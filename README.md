We introduce the **BEHAVIOR Robot Suite** (BRS), a comprehensive framework for learning whole-body manipulation to tackle diverse real-world household tasks. BRS addresses both hardware and learning challenges through two key innovations: **WB-VIMA** and [JoyLo](https://github.com/behavior-robot-suite/brs-ctrl).

WB-VIMA is an imitation learning algorithm designed to model whole-body actions by leveraging the robot’s inherent kinematic hierarchy. A key insight behind WB-VIMA is that robot joints exhibit strong interdependencies—small movements in upstream links (e.g., the torso) can lead to large displacements in downstream links (e.g., the end-effectors). To ensure precise coordination across all joints, WB-VIMA **conditions action predictions for downstream components on those of upstream components**, resulting in more synchronized whole-body movements. Additionally, WB-VIMA **dynamically aggregates multi-modal observations using self-attention**, allowing it to learn expressive policies while mitigating overfitting to proprioceptive inputs.

## Getting Started

> [!TIP]
> 🚀 Check out the [doc](https://behavior-robot-suite.github.io/docs/sections/wbvima/overview.html) for detailed installation and usage instructions!

To train a WB-VIMA policy, simply run the following command:

```bash
python3 main/train/train.py data_dir=<HDF5_PATH> \
    bs=<BS> \
    arch=wbvima \
    task=<TASK_NAME> \
    exp_root_dir=<EXP_ROOT_DIR> \
    gpus=<NUM_GPUS> \
    use_wandb=<USE_WANDB> \
    wandb_project=<WANDB_PROJECT>
```

To deploy a WB-VIMA policy on the real robot, simply run the following command:

```bash
python3 main/rollout/<TASK_NAME>/rollout_async.py --ckpt_path <CKPT_PATH> --action_execute_start_idx <IDX>
```
